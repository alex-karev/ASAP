Style: Command of language, including effective and compelling word choice and varied sentence structure, clearly supports the writer's purpose and audience.

Conventions: Consistent, appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation for the grade level.


Ideas and Content: The writing lacks a central idea or purpose. The writing is characterized by

- ideas that are extremely limited or simply unclear.
- attempts at development that are minimal or nonexistent; the paper is too short to demonstrate the development of an idea.

Organization: The writing lacks coherence; organization seems haphazard and disjointed. Even after rereading, the reader remains confused. The writing is characterized by

- a lack of effective sequencing and paragraph breaks.
- a failure to provide an identifiable beginning, body and/or ending.
- a lack of transitions.
- pacing that is consistently awkward; the reader feels either mired down in trivia or rushed along too rapidly.
- a lack of organization which ultimately obscures or distorts the main point.

Voice: The writing seems to lack a sense of involvement or commitment. The writing is characterized by

- no engagement of the writer; the writing is flat and lifeless.
- a lack of audience awareness; there is no sense of “writing to be read.”
- no hint of the writer behind the words. There is no sense of interaction between writer and reader; the writing does not involve or engage the reader.

Word Choice: The writing shows an extremely limited vocabulary or is so filled with misuses of words that the meaning is obscured. Only the most general kind of message is communicated because of vague or imprecise language. The writing is characterized by

- general, vague words that fail to communicate.
- an extremely limited range of words.
- words that simply do not fit the text; they seem imprecise, inadequate, or just plain wrong.

Sentence Fluency: The writing is difficult to follow or to read aloud. Sentences tend to be incomplete, rambling, or very awkward. The writing is characterized by

- text that does not invite—and may not even permit—smooth oral reading.
- confusing word order that is often jarring and irregular.
- sentence structure that frequently obscures meaning.
- sentences that are disjointed, confusing, or rambling.

Conventions: Numerous errors in usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation repeatedly distract the reader and make the text difficult to read. In fact, the severity and frequency of errors are so overwhelming that the reader finds it difficult to focus on the message and must reread for meaning. The writing is characterized by

- very limited skill in using conventions.
- basic punctuation (including end-of-sentence punctuation) that tends to be omitted, haphazard, or incorrect.
- frequent spelling errors that significantly impair readability.
- capitalization that appears to be random.
- a need for extensive editing.

- a purpose and main idea(s) that may require extensive inferences by the reader.
- minimal development; insufficient details.
- irrelevant details that clutter the text.
- extensive repetition of detail.

Organization: The writing lacks a clear organizational structure. An occasional organizational device is discernible; however, the writing is either difficult to follow and the reader has to reread substantial portions, or the piece is simply too short to demonstrate organizational skills. The writing is characterized by

- some attempts at sequencing, but the order or the relationship among ideas is frequently unclear; a lack of paragraph breaks.
- a missing or extremely undeveloped beginning, body, and/or ending.
- a lack of transitions, or when present, ineffective or overused.
- a lack of an effective organizational structure.
- details that seem to be randomly placed, leaving the reader frequently confused.

- a lack of audience awareness; there is little sense of “writing to be read.”
- little or no hint of the writer behind the words. There is rarely a sense of interaction between reader and writer.

Word Choice: Language is monotonous and/or misused, detracting from the meaning and impact. The writing is characterized by

- words that are colorless, flat or imprecise.
- monotonous repetition or overwhelming reliance on worn expressions that repeatedly detract from the message.
- images that are fuzzy or absent altogether.

Sentence Fluency: The writing tends to be either choppy or rambling. Awkward constructions often force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by

- predictable or overly-obvious main ideas; or points that echo observations heard elsewhere; or a close retelling of another work.
- support that is attempted, but developmental details are often limited, uneven, somewhat off-topic, predictable, or too general (e.g., a list of underdeveloped points).
- details that may not be well-grounded in credible resources; they may be based on clichés, stereotypes or questionable sources of information.
- difficulties when moving from general observations to specifics.

Organization: An attempt has been made to organize the writing; however, the overall structure is inconsistent or skeletal. The writing is characterized by

- attempts at sequencing and paragraph breaks, but the order or the relationship among ideas may occasionally be unclear.
- a beginning and an ending which, although present, are either undeveloped or too obvious (e.g., “My topic is...”; “These are all the reasons that...”).
- transitions that sometimes work. The same few transitional devices (e.g., coordinating conjunctions, numbering, etc.) may be overused.
- a structure that is skeletal or too rigid.
- placement of details that may not always be effective.
- organization which lapses in some places, but helps the reader in others.

Voice: The writer’s commitment to the topic seems inconsistent. A sense of the writer may emerge at times; however, the voice is either inappropriately personal or inappropriately impersonal. The writing is characterized by

- a limited sense of audience; the writer’s awareness of the reader is unclear.
- an occasional sense of the writer behind the words; however, the voice may shift or disappear a line or two later and the writing become somewhat mechanical.
- a limited ability to shift to a more objective voice when necessary.
- text that is too short to demonstrate a consistent and appropriate voice.

Word Choice: Language lacks precision and variety, or may be inappropriate to audience and purpose in places. The writer does not employ a variety of words, producing a sort of “generic” paper filled with familiar words and phrases. The writing is characterized by

- expression that seems mundane and general; slang, if used, does not seem purposeful and is not effective.
- attempts at colorful language that seem overdone or forced.
- words that are accurate for the most part, although misused words may occasionally appear; technical language or jargon may be overused or inappropriately used.
- reliance on clichés and overused expressions.
- text that is too short to demonstrate variety.

Sentence Fluency: The writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. Occasional awkward constructions may force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by

- some passages that invite fluid oral reading; however, others do not.

- good control over simple sentence structures, but little control over more complex sentences; fragments, if present, may not be effective.
- sentences which, although functional, lack energy.
- lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, may sound stilted or unnatural.
- text that is too short to demonstrate variety and control.

Conventions: The writing demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions (e.g., punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage). Errors begin to impede readability. The writing is characterized by

- spelling errors that distract the reader; misspelling of common words occurs.
- capitalization errors.
- errors in grammar and usage that do not block meaning but do distract the reader.
- significant need for editing.

- a body that is easy to follow with details that fit where placed.
- transitions that may be stilted or formulaic.
- organization which helps the reader, despite some weaknesses.

Voice: A voice is present. The writer seems committed to the topic, and there may be a sense of “writing to be read.” In places, the writing is expressive, engaging, or sincere. The writing is characterized by

- a suitable level of closeness to or distance from the audience.
- a sense of audience; the writer seems to be aware of the reader but has not consistently employed an appropriate voice. The reader may glimpse the writer behind the words and feel a sense of interaction in places.
- liveliness, sincerity, or humor when appropriate; however, at times the writing may be either inappropriately casual or personal, or inappropriately formal and stiff.

Word Choice: Words effectively convey the intended message. The writer employs a variety of words that are functional and appropriate to audience and purpose. The writing is characterized by

- words that work but do not particularly energize the writing.
- expression that is functional; however, slang, if used, does not seem purposeful and is not particularly effective.
- attempts at colorful language that may occasionally seem overdone.
- occasional overuse of technical language or jargon.
- rare experiments with language; however, the writing may have some fine moments and generally avoids clichés.

Sentence Fluency: The writing flows; however, connections between phrases or sentences may be less than fluid. Sentence patterns are somewhat varied, contributing to ease in oral reading. The writing is characterized by

- a natural sound; the reader can move easily through the piece, although it may lack a certain rhythm and grace.
- some repeated patterns of sentence structure, length, and beginnings that may detract somewhat from overall impact.
- strong control over simple sentence structures, but variable control over more complex sentences; fragments, if present, are usually effective.
- occasional lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural for the most part, but may at times sound stilted or unnatural.

Conventions: The writing demonstrates control of standard writing conventions (e.g., punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage). Significant errors do not occur frequently. Minor errors, while perhaps noticeable, do not impede readability. The writing is characterized by

- control over conventions used, although a wide range is not demonstrated.
- correct end-of-sentence punctuation; internal punctuation may sometimes be incorrect.
